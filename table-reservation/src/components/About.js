        Little Lemon was founded by chefs Mario and Adrian with a mission to bring authentic Italian flavors to their hometown of Chicago. Inspired by family recipes and traditional cooking techniques, they created a warm, inviting space where guests can enjoy handcrafted pasta, wood-fired pizzas, and classic Italian dishes made with the freshest ingredients. At Little Lemon, every meal is a celebration of rich flavors, quality ingredients, and the joy of sharing great food. Buon appetito! üçã
